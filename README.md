Video Course Cards contains two connected components:

- a FastAPI, React, SQLite, and Tauri application that transcribes local course
  videos, performs semantic chunking, generates evidence-linked cards with a
  local Qwen model, and supports course organization, review, retrieval, and
  Markdown export;
- isolated research packages for controlled multimodal reading and RAG
  experiments, with versioned protocols, lecture-level splits, dataset hashes,
  sealed evaluation gates, and machine-readable results.

## Experiment 1: CNN vs ViT Slide-Line Recognition

### Protocol

The benchmark contains 1,402 text-line crops from five independent CS231n
lectures:

| Split | Lectures | Lines | Use |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Train | Lectures 1-3 | 1,159 | Model fitting |
| Validation | Lecture 4 | 67 | Checkpoint selection |
| Test | Lecture 5 | 176 | Sealed evaluation, opened once |

The comparison controls the following variables:

- identical real and synthetic training data;
- identical character tokenizer and CTC decoding contract;
- identical line-height normalization and augmentation policy;
- identical shared trainer, evaluator, optimizer policy, and validation-based
  checkpoint selection;
- approximately matched parameter counts;
- the same 32-line exact-overfit gate before full training.

The CNN uses convolutional residual blocks followed by a shared CTC projection
head. The ViT uses handwritten patch embedding, positional embeddings, and
Transformer encoder blocks with the same CTC head.

### Sealed test result

| Reader | Parameters | CER down | WER down | Exact lines up | Median CPU ms/line down |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| CNN-CTC v2 | 120,629 | **0.1150** | **0.3155** | **73 / 176** | 4.414 |
| ViT-CTC v1 | 111,253 | 0.4461 | 0.9442 | 5 / 176 | **0.687** |
| RapidOCR stored text | not measured | **0.0071** | **0.0408** | **158 / 176** | not measured |

The paired CNN-minus-ViT CER difference is `-0.3311`, with a 95% bootstrap
interval of `[-0.4126, -0.2551]`. All 5,000 bootstrap resamples favor the CNN.
Both models passed the same capacity check with `32/32` exact lines and zero
CER before the formal experiment.

### Interpretation

The result supports a small-data conclusion: under the recorded lecture-level
split and matched training setup, the convolutional inductive bias generalizes
better than the scratch ViT. It does not establish that CNNs are universally
better slide readers. The ViT is substantially faster per line but fails to
generalize from the available data.

RapidOCR is a practical pretrained reference, not a matched architecture
comparison. Its stored predictions use already accepted detector polygons, so
page-level detection recall and detector latency are excluded.

Code and records:

- models: `backend/multimodal_lab/models/cnn_ctc.py` and
  `backend/multimodal_lab/models/vit_ctc.py`;
- shared training: `backend/multimodal_lab/training/`;
- [full study](docs/Multimodal%20CNN%20ViT%20reader%20study.md);
- [frozen protocol and results](docs/experiments/assignment_5_protocol_results.json).

## Experiment 2: OCR Error Propagation Into Generated Cards

The three OCR outputs were reconstructed into the same 16 slide pages. Each
page was passed to `qwen3:4b` with the same prompt, temperature zero, model
digest, and output validator. Gold concepts were not included in the prompt.

| OCR source | Successful generations | Concept recall up | Grounded claim precision up | Citation correctness up | Usable-card conversion up |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| CNN-CTC v2 | 14 / 16 | **0.7500** | 0.8667 | 0.6250 | 0.3750 |
| ViT-CTC v1 | **16 / 16** | 0.4375 | 0.4375 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 |
| RapidOCR stored text | 12 / 16 | **0.7500** | **0.9167** | **0.9231** | **0.6875** |

The ViT condition is the clearest failure case: every page produced a
schema-valid output, but no output met the usable-card criterion. Parsing
success is therefore a poor proxy for knowledge quality. Recognition errors in
technical terms, formulas, grouping, arrows, and layout propagate into concept
omissions, unsupported claims, and incorrect citations.

This experiment is exploratory. It contains only 16 pages, was run after an
infrastructure revision, and uses one model-assisted source auditor. The sealed
claim applies to the reader comparison, not to these downstream rates.

## Experiment 3: Card-Level Retrieval Baselines

### Corpus and protocol

The RAG corpus is a frozen snapshot of:

- 118 cards;
- 140 claims;
- 150 timestamped evidence spans;
- 100 candidate questions covering factual, conceptual, comparison,
  multi-hop, and unanswerable cases.

The current results use the 40-question development split. The 60-question test
split is blocked until all questions, gold cards, claims, evidence spans, and
graph decisions receive independent human review.

Dense retrieval uses `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`. All methods use
the same corpus and top-k evaluation. Graph variants start from the same Dense
anchors and perform one-hop expansion.

### Development result

| Retriever | Recall@1 up | Recall@5 up | MRR up | nDCG@5 up | Multi-hop joint R@3 up | Median ms down |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| BM25 | 0.406 | 0.859 | 0.737 | 0.746 | 0.375 | **0.80** |
| Dense MiniLM | 0.594 | **1.000** | **0.901** | **0.924** | 0.750 | 24.19 |
| BM25 + Dense RRF | **0.609** | 0.969 | 0.891 | 0.898 | 0.500 | 25.30 |
| Dense + noisy graph | 0.562 | **1.000** | 0.875 | 0.904 | 0.750 | 24.97 |
| Dense + candidate graph | 0.422 | **1.000** | 0.805 | 0.852 | **0.875** | 24.57 |

Dense retrieval is the strongest current direct-question baseline. Compared
with BM25, it improves Recall@5 by `0.141`, MRR by `0.164`, nDCG@5 by `0.178`,
and multi-hop joint Recall@3 by `0.375`, at roughly 23 ms additional median
latency.

RRF does not improve over Dense on this development set. Candidate graph
expansion improves multi-hop joint Recall@3 by `0.125`, but reduces overall
nDCG@5 by `0.072` and single-card nDCG@5 by `0.163`. The bootstrap intervals
are `[0.000, 0.375]`, `[-0.133, -0.016]`, and `[-0.255, -0.077]`, respectively.
The graph therefore introduces a measurable coverage-ranking tradeoff rather
than a general retrieval improvement.

Unanswerable false-retrieval rates are `0.125` for BM25, `0.000` for Dense,
`0.375` for RRF, and `0.000` for both graph variants under the recorded scoring
policy.

## Experiment 4: Grounded Generation And Graph Ablation

Dense and Dense-plus-candidate-graph retrieval were passed to the same
`qwen3:4b` model with identical top-5 context size, 6,000-character budget,
prompt, temperature, and confidence gate.

| System | Claim citation recall up | Citation precision up | Abstention F1 up | Reference cosine proxy up | Median generation ms down |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Dense | 0.8125 | 0.8125 | **0.9841** | 0.8547 | 6,883.9 |
| Dense + candidate graph | **0.8333** | **0.8163** | **0.9841** | **0.8566** | **6,864.1** |

Graph expansion changes the top-5 set for 9 of 40 questions and changes eight
generated answers. It produces one gold-claim citation-recall win, 39 ties, no
losses, and no multi-hop answer gain. The overall citation-recall difference is
`0.0156` with a bootstrap interval of `[0.0000, 0.0469]`.

The reference-answer cosine value is only a semantic proxy and is not reported
as answer correctness. Independent correctness and entailment review remains
unfinished.

Prompt-only abstention failed on all eight unsupported development questions.
A pre-generation Dense-confidence gate correctly refused all eight, with one
shared false abstention on an answerable question, producing `0.9841`
development F1. This threshold is development-calibrated and is not a test
result.

## Graph Diagnostic

The candidate relation graph was also measured independently from QA:

| Measurement | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| Candidate edges | 20 |
| Covered cards | 32 / 118, 27.1% |
| Isolated cards | 86 |
| Largest connected component | 4 cards |
| Candidate-edge mean cosine | 0.515 |
| Lecture-matched random non-edge mean cosine | 0.267 |
| Edges with an endpoint outside Dense top-5 | 9 / 20, 45.0% |

The graph is too sparse to support a large-scale knowledge-memory claim. The
current result only motivates a later scale experiment: typed relations may be
more useful for exploration, prerequisite paths, and curriculum organization
than for unconditional direct-QA expansion.

See [Graph as an Associative Knowledge Structure](docs/Graph%20as%20associative%20knowledge%20structure.md)
for the null baseline, proposed scale study, and falsification conditions.

Research code is kept outside the product package:

```text
backend/app              product APIs and SQLite workflows
backend/multimodal_lab   OCR data, models, training, and sealed evaluation
backend/rag_lab          corpus snapshots, retrievers, generation, and metrics
docs/experiments         compact versioned protocols and results
```

## Installation

Download the packaged Windows application from the
[latest release](https://github.com/eatoften/Video_Course_Cards/releases/latest).
The current release is `v0.1.1`.

The installer does not bundle model weights. Install Ollama and pull the
default generation model:

```powershell
ollama pull qwen3:4b
```

FFmpeg, Ollama/Qwen, and the configured Sentence Transformer must be available
for their corresponding features. See [local model setup](docs/local-llm.md)
and [desktop packaging](docs/tauri-desktop.md).

Current desktop constraints:

- Windows is the only packaged target exercised;
- the installer is not code-signed;
- local model installation remains user-managed;
- Markdown export is a snapshot and does not synchronize back into SQLite.

## Developer Setup

Requirements: Python 3.11, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Node.js 22,
FFmpeg, and Ollama.

Start the backend:

```powershell
cd backend
$env:PYTHONUTF8='1'
$env:PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE='1'
uv sync
uv run python -B -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001 --reload
```

Start the frontend in a second terminal:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm.cmd install
npm.cmd run dev
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5174`. FastAPI documentation is available at
`http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs`.

## Reproducing The Experiments

Run the complete backend suite:

```powershell
cd backend
uv run pytest
```

Current verification: `302 passed, 1 warning`.

| Experiment | Main entry point | Record |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CNN/ViT training | `backend/multimodal_lab/run_train_reader.py` | `backend/multimodal_lab/configs/reader_cnn_v2.json`, `reader_vit_v1.json` |
| Sealed reader comparison | `backend/multimodal_lab/run_reader_comparison.py` | [Assignment 5 result](docs/experiments/assignment_5_protocol_results.json) |
| OCR-to-card cascade | `backend/multimodal_lab/run_reader_card_cascade.py` | [CNN/ViT report](docs/Multimodal%20CNN%20ViT%20reader%20study.md) |
| Retrieval baselines | `backend/rag_lab/run_retrieval_experiment.py` | [R2 result](docs/experiments/rag_r2_development_results.json) |
| Grounded generation | `backend/rag_lab/run_grounded_answer_experiment.py` | [R3/R4 result](docs/experiments/rag_r3_r4_development_results.json) |
| Graph audit | `backend/rag_lab/run_graph_organization_audit.py` | [Graph result](docs/experiments/rag_graph_organization_audit_v1.json) |

Videos, extracted frames, line crops, full prediction logs, embeddings, and
checkpoints remain under ignored `backend/data/` paths. Git tracks code,
protocols, hashes, compact results, and validity notes. Exact OCR numbers cannot
be reproduced without recreating the non-redistributable lecture inputs that
match the recorded hashes.

The Lecture 5 OCR test is closed to further tuning. The RAG test runner remains
blocked until candidate benchmark and graph annotations are independently
reviewed and sealed.

## Limitations

- The controlled OCR result covers one sealed lecture from one course and slide
  family.
- RapidOCR is evaluated on accepted line polygons, not full-page detection.
- The card cascade contains 16 pages and one model-assisted source auditor.
- The RAG tables are development results over candidate annotations.
- Only eight development questions test multi-hop retrieval.
- The 20-edge graph covers 27.1% of cards and is not a large-scale graph result.
- The visual research pipeline is not yet integrated into the desktop product.

## Next Experiments

1. Independently review and seal the RAG benchmark before opening its test set.
2. Add a new held-out lecture and a second auditor for the multimodal cascade.
3. Evaluate Dense, typed traversal, and query-conditioned graph routing over
   larger frozen card-corpus snapshots under equal latency and context budgets.
